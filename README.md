# Raichu
A utility Discord bot for the Nincord server.

Raichu is a simple bot that is currently being developed and expanded on. It is primarily a moderation bot, however it has other purposes. Unfortunately, Raichu is not made with any other server in mind besides Nincord, so in order to make the bot properly work in other servers, it will have to be heavily modified. The source code is open for anyone to view and see how Raichu works. Raichu is written in Python, and uses the Discord.py package.

Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request which shortens or simplifies code, adds new commands you want to see, or anything else! Contributors might be elligible for special bonuses on the Nincord server.
